the Rounded.shp file did not have completely contiguous subgraphs 
of each congressional district (column name CD). 

The two districts that failed were 3607 and 3608. 

In order to fix this problem, we changed the outlying vtds that were 
incorrectly assigned into the district that their neighbors belonged to. 

The problematic vtds are shown in closeup in the folder discontiguous_pics.

After this, we used the construct_graph functionality in RunDMCMC to create 
rook and queen adjacency graphs
